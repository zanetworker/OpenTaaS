## taas

taas provides easily configurable services on the fly

### Synopsis



OpenTaaS (Tool-as-a-Service) is a platform that provides DevOps tools on demand (lego style). relieving you from manually configuring and tinkering with the tools and their config files.
It should also deploy, monitor, and secure them for you on the platform of choice (e.g., hosted ~ [k8s, compose, swarm, etc]  or cloud-based ~ [AWS, OpenStack, Azure, etc])   

Environment:
$TAAS_HOME          set an alternative TaaS location for files. By default, these are stored in ~/.taas


```
taas [flags]
```

### Options

```
      --debug         enable verbose output
  -h, --help          help for taas
      --home string   location of your Taas config. Overrides $TAAS_HOME (default "/Users/adelias/.taas")
```
